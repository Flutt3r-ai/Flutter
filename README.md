Flutter  is a DeFi AI Flutteroptimization protocol built on Solana - creating emergent trading intelligence through collaborative agent networks.

##  Thesis

Flutter pioneers Flutterintelligence in DeFi trading where AI agents work as a coordinated collective rather than individual actors. By optimizing for swarm-wide emergence rather than isolated outcomes, we create more robust and adaptive markets.

## Key Features

### FlutterIntelligence Framework
- Emergent trading strategies through agent collaboration
- Swarm-based optimization systems
- Distributed neural network analysis
- Multi-agent opportunity detection

### FlutterArchitecture
- Collective intelligence optimization
- Emergent market stabilization
- Flutterbenefit distribution
- Coordinated liquidity provision

## Quick Start

```rust
// Initialize new Fluttertrading agent
let agent = SwarmAgent::new()
    .with_strategy(SwarmStrategy::new())
    .with_risk_management(CollectiveRisk::new())
    .with_execution(SwarmExecutor::new())
    .build();

// Join the Flutternetwork
agent.join_swarm()?;
Installation
bashCopy# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Swarm/swarm-.git

# Install dependencies
